    <p>
      Our <span class="font-semibold">Trajectory Calculator</span> helps you
      determine the precise bullet drop at various distances. By inputting key
      data such as bullet weight, velocity, and environmental conditions, you
      can accurately predict the path of your shot. This ensures that your
      rounds hit their mark, no matter the range or conditions.

      Maximum Point Blank Range (MPBR) Calculator
    </h3>
    <p>
      With the
      <span class="font-semibold">Maximum Point Blank Range Calculator</span>,
      you'll know the optimal distance at which your rifle can be zeroed without
      having to make any elevation adjustments. MPBR helps you set your zero in
      a way that maximizes your effective range, allowing you to confidently aim
      and shoot without worrying about bullet drop over typical hunting
      distances.
